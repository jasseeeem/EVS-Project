# EVS-Project


This <a href="https://solarforindia.herokuapp.com/">web app</a> uses the data you give and your location to calculate how feasible it is to put solar panels and how long it would take to get back the money invested. This was created as part of an EVS Project titled 'Feasibility of Solar Power in India'.

<a href="https://developer.here.com/documentation/geocoding-search-api/dev_guide/topics-api/code-revgeocode.html">MapMyIndia</a> API was used for map functionality along with <a href="https://www.mapmyindia.com/api/">revgeocode</a> API for geocoding.
